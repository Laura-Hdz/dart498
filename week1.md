# Week 1: Graduate Schools research

This topic of graduate schools was particularly difficult to look into—obviously not because of a lack of information or lack of schools available—but because I have never given graduate studies any thought. My mindset has been narrowed to finishing my bachelor’s degree in order to start working full time as quickly as I possibly can and get away from the school setting.

With that in mind, my main focus points when looking for graduate programs were: graphic design (particularly web design), affordability and quality of living.
