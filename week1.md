# Week 1: Graduate Schools research

This topic of graduate schools was particularly difficult to look into—obviously not because of a lack of information or lack of schools available—but because I have never given graduate studies any thought. My mindset has been narrowed to finishing my bachelor’s degree in order to start working full time as quickly as I possibly can and get away from the school setting. Research in itself has never been a big interest of mine; I do enjoy learning, but I enjoy it at my own pace and like having the freedom to change my mind about the subjects I’m looking into. I’m of the belief that going into a graduate setting will restrict that freedom and add a layer of stress that will prevent me from fully appreciating the learning process.

With that in mind, my main focus points when looking for graduate programs were: graphic design (particularly web design), affordability and quality of living.
